# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Capstone and aims to predict the success of Falcon 9 rocket landings using real-world SpaceX launch data.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using data collected from SpaceX's public API and web scraping Wikipedia, I performed end-to-end data analysis and built predictive models to determine the likelihood of a successful landing for Falcon 9 first stages.

## 🧰 What's Included

- `api.ipynb`: Collect SpaceX launch data using REST API
- `webscraping.ipynb`: Scrape booster version and payload data from Wikipedia
- `sql.ipynb`: Analyze mission data using SQLite and SQL queries
- `Folium.ipynb`: Build interactive launch site map using Folium
- `Visualization.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and plots
- `predictions.ipynb`: Classification model development (LogReg, SVM, RF)
- `spacex_launch_dash.csv`: Cleaned dataset used in Plotly Dash
- `spacex_dash_app.py`: Interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash
- `launch_site_map.html`: Folium map of launch locations

## 🧠 Tools Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- BeautifulSoup, Requests
- Folium, Plotly Dash
- SQLite, ipython-sql

## 📍 Key Outcomes

- Identified launch trends and high-performance booster configurations
- Mapped launch site locations and proximity to coast, rail, and road
- Built classification models with accuracy evaluation
- Designed interactive dashboard and maps

## 📎 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies (see `.ipynb` requirements)
3. Open notebooks in Jupyter
4. Run dashboard with: `python spacex_dash_app.py`
